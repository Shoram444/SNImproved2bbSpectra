# SNImproved2bbSpectra

**This repository is a work-in-progress repository for my analysis on the improved spectral shapes analysis for SuperNEMO Experiment. The main file is the `230424_report_comparisonImprovedSpectra.pdf` located at the root of the repository.**

This file contains a `Pluto` Notebook with all the relevant information. 

A short script is also provided for a simple analysis (`AnalysisScript.jl`).

Additional notebooks for some of the other (miscelnacious) works can be found in the folder `./other`. 

The main `AnalysisModule` with it's subfiles is located in `./src/`.
